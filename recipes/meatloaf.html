        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium carrot, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 rib celery, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>½ medium red bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>4 white mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>2 ½ pounds ground chuck</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with lightly greased foil.</li>
            <li>Place carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until very finely chopped, almost to a purée. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add ground chuck to the vegetables, along with Worcestershire sauce, egg, Italian herbs, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Mix gently with a wooden spoon until ingredients are just combined. Sprinkle in bread crumbs and gently mix with your fingertips until just combined; don't overmix.</li>
            <li>Shape the mixture into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across. Place in the prepared baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon, and Sriracha for glaze in a small bowl until brown sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Remove meatloaf from the oven. Spoon glaze on the top of the meatloaf with the back of a spoon, then pull a tiny bit glaze down the sides.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven, and bake until no longer pink inside, 45 to 75 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), so start checking at 45 minutes and continue baking until meatloaf reaches that temperature. Cooking time will depend on shape and thickness of the meatloaf.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
